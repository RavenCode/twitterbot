# Twitter Bot

## A baseline gateway for a Twitterbot.  What it has to say, will come shortly.

Instructions for obtaining keys and tokens, and the basic Python for accessing the Twitter API can be found [here](http://www.dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/).


The rest of this document will fill out as I decide what it will actually do.
